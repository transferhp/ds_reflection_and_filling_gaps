# :books: ds_reflection_and_filling_gaps

This repository lists out all self-organised resources that I found quite useful to reflect myself and fill the gaps before attending a data science interview.

:warning: The curated resources are created by considering my condition, which may not apply to others.

----------

**SQL**: [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com) 

> Used to quickly recall sql basics and intermediate topics with interactive exercises.


**Coding**: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)

> Used to practise computer science concepts, like data structure and algorithms. Not all company requires leetcode coding test, but at least it is required for trading company and top-tier technology company.


**Machine Learning**: 

- [algorithm implementation from scratch](https://github.com/tushushu/imylu)

> Used to review classical/marjor machine learning algorithms and corresponding python code implementations.

- [metrics for imbalanced classification](https://machinelearningmastery.com/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-classification-in-python/)

> Explain which metric to use for imbalance data set. TLDR: **use precision-recall curve for highly imbalanced data, use ROC curve when classes are balanced and it tells how model differentiates both classes**.


**Statistics**:

- [Hypothesis test](https://towardsdatascience.com/hypothesis-testing-for-data-scientists-everything-you-need-to-know-8c36ddde4cd2)

> Used to grasp basic concepts in stistical test.


- [Distribution](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-probability-distribution-you-should-know-as-a-data-scientist-f8abc9522af0)

> Used to go through common distributions applied in data science area.


**A/B testing**
- [A/B testing each data scientist should know](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/ab-testing-data-science/)

> Used to explain A/B testing theory and end-to-end process.


**System Architecture Design**: 

- [ML system design](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-answer-any-machine-learning-system-design-interview-question-a98656bb7ff0)

> A template for answering any machine learning system design question at your next interview.
